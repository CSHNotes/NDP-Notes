# Collecting Information
## Collect info before first meeting
* Products produced/Services supplied
* Financial viability
* Customers, suppliers, competitors
* Competitive advantage

## Meeting with customer
###Concise statement of the goals
* what are they trying to solve?
* how will new tech help?
* what must happen for the project to succeed?

### Contingency planning!
* critical?
* what happens if it fails?
* visible to upper management?
* who's on your side?

### Discover bias
* will only use certain company's products
* avoid certain technologies?
* data people look down on voice people or vice versa?
* talk to tech and management staff

### Organization chart
* General structure of organization
* Suggest users to account for
* Suggest geographical locations to account for

### Get copy of policy
* policy affect new design?
* new design affect policy?
* policy lax enough for you to do job?

### Start cataloging assets that require security
* Hardware, software, applications and data
* Intellectual property, trade secrets and a company's rep

* Small in scope?
    * Allows sales people to access VPN
* Large in scope?
    * Entire redesign of enterprise network
* Use OSI model to clarify
    * New financial reporting application vs. routing proto
* Does the scope fit budget, capabilities and schedule?

### More detail
* Applications
* User communities
* Data stores
* Protocols
* Current logical and physical architecture
* Current performance

## Renewal and Replacement Planning
* Staged plan to replace hardware or software in defined cycles
* Requires multi-year budget planning
* Takes into account
    * demand and performance
    * maintenance cost
    * product life cycles
* Fits corporate network environments

## Discussing technical priorities
### Scalability
* Ability to grow
* Some technologies do not grow well
    * Flat networks do not scale well
* Try to learn
    * Number of sites
    * Needs of sites
    * How man users
    * Number of servers
    * Additional external services
    * Additional internal services
    * Expected growth
### Availability
Can be expressed as a percent uptime per year, month, week, day or hour 
compared to the total time in that period

Avoiding downtime:
* Redundancy
* Resiliency - how much stress the network can handle

Can also be expressed in terms of mean time between failure and mean time to 
repair
* Availability = MTBF/(MTBF + MTTR)
* MTBF = average time between failures
* MTTR = average time it takes to repair

Disaster recovery
* need to sustain business after a disaster
* what do you need to think about?
* testing

### Performance
### Security
### Manageability
### Usability
### Adaptability
### Affordability
