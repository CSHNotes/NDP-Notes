# Designing a network topology

Structure of a network

## Design themes
* Hierarchy
* Redundancy
* Modularity
* Well-defined entries and exits
* Protected perimeters

## Hierarchical model
* Reduces workload on network devices
* Constrains broadcast domains
* Enhances simplicity and understanding
* Facilitates changes
* Facilitates scaling
