# Network Design

Two basic designs:

* Top down
* Bottom up

Selection depends on the circumstances. Bottom-up is perfect for small changes or temporary networks. Top down is for
more permanent, larger networks where you're not altogether clear on the customer's needs prior to designing the network.

## Bottoms up!

* Establish where connectivity is needed
* Design
* Configure

Bottoms up is significantly quicker than a top down approach

## Top Down

* Establish what applications are needed
* Identify customer needs, goals and constraints
* Determine traffic patterns, protocols and device config
* Choose devices
* Design
* Test

Top down is an approach in which customer needs and constraints are the focus of the design, rather than the infrastructure.
It should maatch business needs to current technology.

### Customer goals

Must be considered before designing a network

* Scalability
    * Can the network expand with the business?
* Capability
    * Does the network accomplish stated business goals
* Availability
    * Uptime
* Usability
    * Is it easy for employees to get work done?
* Manageability
    * Can future netadmins manage the network easily?
* Adaptability
    * Can the network change with customer needs?
* Affordability
    * Can the business afford the network?
* Compatibility
    * Does the new network merge seamlessly into the existing architecture?
* Maintainability
    * Can future netadmins support the network easily?

### Business goals

* Increase revenue
* Reduce operating costs
* Improve communications
* Shorten product development cycle
* Expand into worldwide markets
* Build partnerships with other companies
* Offer better customer support and services

### Business priorities

* Mobility
* Security
* Resiliency
* Business continuity after failure
* Fiscal goals
* Low delay for real time applications
* Cost reduction

### Network Life Cycle

PDIOO - Plan, Design, Implement, Operate, Optimize

1. Analyze business and technical goals
    * Analyze business goals and constraints
    * Analyze technical goals and constraints
    * Characterize existing network
    * Characterize network traffic
1. Develop logical design
    * Design topology
    * Design addressing and naming
    * Select protocols
    * Develop security and management strategies
1. Develop physical design
    * Select tech and devices for networks
1. Test, optimize and document the design
    * Do so in a simulation - cheap and quick
1. Implement and test
1. Monitor and optimize
1. Repeat as necessary for network growth and change

### Structured Design

* Focus on data flow, types and processes that need to access or modify data
* Focus on understanding location and needs of users to access or modify data
* Several techniques and models will be used to characterize existing setups, requirements and future systems
* Logical model comes before physical
    * Logical model is divided by function and structure
    * Physical represents specific devices, technologies and implementations

### Systems Development Life Cycles

Typical systems are developed and continue to exist over a period of time
